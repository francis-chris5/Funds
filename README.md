An upcoming project I've been thinking about for a while, some accounting software, it will be a while before it's ready though...


So the idea here is some accounting software to sort of accompany the Routines application.

A small accounting application, more for tracking a project (go with Routines) than for running an entire business (at least to start with)

    double entry method

    balance sheet, cash flows, and a few other standard accounting reports

    a number of charts and graphs tracking the flow of a projects budget as time progresses
        (maybe some projection things to compare to)

Trying to pick a local relational database for this, so far I've looked at:


sqlite-jdbc 3.34.0 for relational database
get from https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/3.34.0/sqlite-jdbc-3.34.0.jar 


apache derby 10.14.2.0
get from https://downloads.apache.org//db/derby/db-derby-10.14.2.0/db-derby-10.14.2.0-bin.zip
