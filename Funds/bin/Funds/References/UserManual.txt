Accounts (Balance Sheet Access)

    The first tab on the Main Graphical User Interface (GUI) appears as a balance sheet listing all available accounts. 

    Clicking an account name will open the ledger for that account -see account ledger instructions to proceed from there

    To create a new category to organize accounts in right-click in the white space for one of the categories (Assets, Liabilities, or Equity) and select "New <TYPE> Category" from the context menu. Alternatively select [Accounts > New Account Category] from the main menu --see create account categories to continue

    To create a new account right-click in the white space for one of the main types (Assets, Liabilities, or Equity) and select "New <TYPE> Account" from the context menu, if categories are available a second "New <TYPE> Account" menu will be available as well. Alternatively select [Accounts > New Account] from the main menu --see create account instructions to proceed

    To modify the order the accounts appear in right click in the white space for one of the main types (Assets, Liabilities, or Equity) and select "Modify <TYPE> Category/Account Order" from the context menu. Alternatively select [Accounts > Modify Category/Account Order] from the main menu --see Modify Order of Categories/Accounts to continue

    To remove an account from the book right click in the white space for one of the main types (Assets, Liabilities, or Equity) and select "Remove <TYPE> Category/Account" from the context menu, select the account(s) to remove (hold ctrl while clicking to make multiple selections) and click the ok button when ready. NOTE: An account can only be removed if it's balance is $0.00, if not please transfer the balance to another existing account and try again to remove it.







Account Ledger

    At the bottom of the table is a yellow row for inputting a new transaction. The only required field is the amount, enter a positive (money in) or negative (money out) and the posting will set it appropriately as a debit or credit based on the account type.

        (Optional) enter a date for the transaction (the default is current date)

        (Optional) an id for the transaction (the transfer account for balancing will receive the same ID)

        (Optional) a short description of the transaction

        (Optional) choose another account to transfer the balance to (if no account is selected there will be an imbalance account created to accept the balance). A debit in the posted transaction will automatically apply as a credit in the transfer and vice-versa. The transfer account will also receive all other fields automatically.

        (Optional) check the box in the reconcile column if necessary (traditionally this column was marked after the fact once a check had cleared, but I don't think this applies much in our modern instant-banking world, I chose to leave it in case a user has another purpose in mind for a yes/no value: I personally use it checked for work expenses that may be reimbursed and unchecked for regular expenses).

        (Required) enter a positive amount for money coming into the account and a negative amount for money leaving the account, the software will handle balancing the books.

    click the add button (leftmost button on the right side of the input row) to post the transaction

    click the clear button (center button on the right side of the input row) to reset the input fields and place focus back on the date input field

    To edit a transaction that has already been posted right click on it and an edit transaction dialog box will open, make the changes and click the okay button, or cancel out of the dialog to keep the transaction as it was.

    To delete a transaction select it from the account ledger and click the delete button (rightmost button on the right side of the input row) --eventually this will delete the balance transfer as well







Create Account Categories

    To create a new category for accounts to be organized in choose a type (Assets, Liabilities, or Equity) from the drop down menu and give it a meaningful name







Create Account

    To create a new account choose a type (Assets, Liabilities, or Equity) of account and parent category if applicable for it from the drop down menus

    Give the account a useful nickname to identify it in the books: the account nickname and balance will show anywhere it is listed

    Use the "Normal" radio buttons to select whether this is to be a normal debit (increases on left column of ledger) or a normal credit (increases on right column of ledger) account

    Fill in the text fields for account number, routing number, account code, and account description as needed

    Click ok button to create the new account







Modify Order of Categories/Accounts
   
    Traditionally accounts are listed by order of liquidity (how fast it can be turned into cash) but the software will initially order categories and accounts in the order created so it may be necessary to adjust the order.

    To modify the display order on the balance sheet right click in the white space for one of the main type trees, and select the "Modify <TYPE> Accounts Order" option. This will open the Modify Account Order Dialog which displays lists populated with all available options. 

    Select the appropriate radio button for modifying either categories or accounts, then select items from the list one at a time and use the up or down buttons to relocate them to the desired location

    NOTE: An account can only be moved up or down among the category it is organized in, and only the selected type of accounts will be shown so the buttons may need clicked more than once to see the change. For example: if you are looking at the list of asset accounts, but internally there are two liability accounts created/listed between the two asset accounts displayed in the list, then the up or down button would need clicked three times before the change will be seen.






Change Category Account is organized in

    I'm still working on a graceful way to do this, so unfortunately it currently involves manually creating a new account, transferring all transactions to the new account via the edit dialog, and then removing the original account 
    





Remove Categories/Accounts

    To remove an unwanted account or category from one of the three main type trees right click in the tree's white space to pull up a context menu and select Remove <TYPE> Accounts. This will open the Remove Account Dialog which displays lists populated with all available options. 

    Select the appropriate radio button for removing either a category or an account (more than one can be selected at a time by holding the ctrl key) and click the Remove Accounts Button

    NOTE: An account cannot be deleted if it has a non-zero balance and a category cannot be deleted if it contains accounts, so zero out or transfer any balances before removing an account and then remove any accounts before removing a category 







TOOLS:

General Ledger

    A listing of all transactions with search and filter functionality. NOTE: there is no editing on the general ledger only filters to find what needs to be edited, a general journal for making/editing entries is on the plan to be included eventually

    The ledger will automatically fill with all available transactions

    select the date or date range to see transactions from and click "Apply Filters" button to remove all but the desired transactions

    enter characters expected to be in a description in the description filter text field and click the "Apply Filters" button to remove all but the transactions which contain the entered characters in the order they are entered (it will find partial matches so the filter does not require the full description)

    Click the "Clear Filters" button to reset the filter inputs and reload the general ledger with all transactions






Revenue Splitter

    The Revenue Splitter is for dividing a payment up between multiple accounts based on percentages: such as in someone's personal accounts 2/3 of a paycheck goes to checking 15% to savings and the remainder goes to petty cash

    Select [Tools > Revenue Splitter] to add the Revenue Splitter Tab to the main content area

    Choose the accounts you want to divide the payment between

    In the "Split Amount" text field enter the amount to be split between the selected accounts

    Use the available controls to determine percentage for each account, and if the account's amount needs excluded from the displayed total, since most money comes in as direct deposit these days a checkbox to exclude the initial one from the total to see how much transfers out of it (for those times when the direct deposit goes to an account with a limited number of monthly transfers --typical savings-- and money needs moved in bulk to an account with unlimited transfers --typical checking-- to shuffle it all around)

    The amount that is to be moved will display in the non-editable "Moving Amount" text field

    The amount field for each control item will display the amount to transfer to each of the selected accounts

    The non-editable Moving Amount text field displays the total which takes the "Exclude From Total" checkbox into consideration

    If the percentage the Split Amount is being divided into exceeds 100% the amount fields will turn red and indicate the percentage is too high

    If this will be a regular division of income the revenue split can be saved, simply give it a name, or leave the name blank and it will show the date the split was saved on, and select the "Save Split" button. CRITICAL NOTE: the splitter uses references to accounts it does not create a different/copy-of account to work with so if the same account shows up in more than one saved split changes to one will affect the other as well as new splits using the same account, changing this will destroy the fairly efficient memory management selected for this software so the suggested workaround if this will be a problem is to create a set of dummy/fake accounts just to get the numbers from the tool instead of working with the actual accounts in the book (it does not make the transfer this tool is only a calculator)

    To reopen a saved split left-click on it in the Saved Splits List View

    To remove a saved split right-click on it in the Saved Splits List View

    To remove a split item from the current set of controls right-click on the item to be removed
