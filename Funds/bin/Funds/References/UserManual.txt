Accounts (Balance Sheet Access)

    The first tab on the Main Graphical User Interface (GUI) appears as a balance sheet listing all available accounts. 

    Clicking an account name will open the ledger for that account -see account ledger instructions to proceed from there

    To create a new account right-click in the white space for one of the categories (Assets, Liabilities, or Equity) and select "New <TYPE> Account" from the context menu --see create account instructions to proceed

    To remove an account from the book right click in the white space for one of the categories (Assets, Liabilities, or Equity) and select "Remove <TYPE> Account" from the context menu, select the account(s) to remove (hold ctrl while clicking to make multiple selections) and click the ok button when ready. NOTE: An account can only be removed if it's balance is $0.00, if not please transfer the balance to another existing account and try again to remove it.






Account Ledger

    At the bottom of the table is a yellow row for inputting a new transaction. The only required field is the amount, enter a positive (money in) or negative (money out) and the posting will set it appropriately as a debit or credit based on the account type.

        (Optional) enter a date for the transaction (the default is current date)

        (Optional) an id for the transaction (the transfer account for balancing will receive the same ID)

        (Optional) a short description of the transaction

        (Optional) choose another account to transfer the balance to (if no account is selected there will be an imbalance account created to accept the balance). A debit in the posted transaction will automatically apply as a credit in the transfer and vice-versa. The transfer account will also receive all other fields automatically.

        (Optional) check the box in the reconcile column if necessary (traditionally this column was marked after the fact once a check had cleared, but I don't think this applies much in our modern instant-banking world, I chose to leave it in case a user has another purpose in mind for a yes/no value: I personally use it checked for work expenses that may be reimbursed and unchecked for regular expenses).

        (Required) enter a positive amount for money coming into the account and a negative amount for money leaving the account, the software will handle balancing the books.

    click the add button (leftmost button on the right side of the input row) to post the transaction

    click the clear button (center button on the right side of the input row) to reset the input fields and place focus back on the date input field

    To edit a transaction that has already been posted right click on it and an edit transaction dialog box will open, make the changes and click the okay button, or cancel out of the dialog to keep the transaction as it was.

    To delete a transaction select it from the account ledger and click the delete button (rightmost button on the right side of the input row) --eventually this will delete the balance transfer as well







Create Account

    To create a new account choose a parent chart for it (Assets, Liabilities, or Equity) from the drop down menu

    Give the account a useful nickname to identify it in the books: the account nickname and balance will show anywhere it is listed

    Use the "Normal" radio buttons to select whether this is to be a normal debit (increases on left column of ledger) or a normal credit (increases on right column of ledger) account

    Fill in the text fields for account number, routing number, account code, and account description as needed

    Click ok button to create the new account
