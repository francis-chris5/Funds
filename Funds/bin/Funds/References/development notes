create accounts in templates needs all strings set to empty string instead of null (like would get from dialog box)




add a way to switch accounts to different categories (a drag and drop interface in tools section)



add some sort of export/import feature (standard data transfer XML, JSON, and CSV)



update status bar while doing stuff
    -it's in the book's inner interface so access through that



SPOTTED BUGS:
couldn't reproduce:     removing equity accounts still show on the equity tree (until close and reopen)
couldn't reproduce:     assets did the same thing once when adding a new account


**That thing happened again, it only seems to occur immediatly after saving
