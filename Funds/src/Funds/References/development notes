create accounts in templates needs all strings set to empty string instead of null (like would get from dialog box)


don't allow special characters in account names (regular file naming exclusions)




add a way to switch accounts to different categories (a drag and drop interface in tools section)



add some sort of export/import feature (standard data transfer XML, JSON, and CSV)



update status bar while doing stuff
    -it's in the book's inner interface so access through that
