STRUCTURE:
    a book is what users will open/save/work-with...

    a book is a collection of Accounts
    an account is a collection of Entries
    an entry is a collection of datafields describing a transaction



NOTES:
    since debit/credit is a boolean I chose debit == true, credit == false for normals (i.e. which side of ledger positive/increase goes on)
