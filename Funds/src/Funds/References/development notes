STRUCTURE:
    a book is what users will open/save/work-with...

    a book is a collection of Accounts
    an account is a collection of Entries
    an entry is a collection of datafields describing a transaction

    entering a transaction will automatically enter it in the corresponding transfer account
    if the transfer is left blank an liability account called "imbalance" will be created (if necessary) to fill the double entry role



USER-INTERFACE:
    The main GUI will consist of a tab-pane showing a number of standard accounting forms (balance sheet, cash-flows, general ledger, etc.) and clicking an account from the statement will open the ledger dialog for the account

    all transactions must be entered or removed via the ledger

    editing a transaction will be handled from a dialog launched from a right-click on the transaction (or other non-accidental method as I find myself accidently editing transactions in GNUCash all the time)




NOTES:
    since debit/credit is a boolean I chose debit == true, credit == false for normals (i.e. which side of ledger positive/increase goes on)

    a book will have the save/open features, .fabk --"Funds Accounting Book"
