The Funds.Tools package is for useful special purpose calculator sort of things I think might be useful here


tools to make
    calculator to split an amount between various accounts based off percentages (i.e. "enveloping" the money)
    a search/find tool to dig up transactions based on either the description or date (maybe other fields too)
