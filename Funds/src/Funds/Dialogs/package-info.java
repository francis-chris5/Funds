 * In an attempt to minimize clutter that typically comes along with GUI's on accounting software most user interaction is handled via dialog boxes and this package holds all of the .java controllers and .fxml GUI's in an attempt to keep this mess of files somewhat organized.
 * 
 * An early draft of the javadocs here had the same sentence on everyone of these: "The controller class for the similarly named FXML dialog" so that essentially describes this whole inner package nicely
